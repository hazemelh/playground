# Migration from Language Understanding (LUIS) to conversational language understanding (CLU)
## Executive Summary
Conversational Language Understanding (CLU) is one of the cloud-based API services offered by Azure Cognitive Services for Language. It is the newest generation of Language Understanding Service (LUIS) and therefore offers backwards compatibility with previously created LUIS applications. CLU employs state-of-the-art machine-learning intelligence to allow users to build a custom natural language understanding model for the prediction of intents and entities of conversational utterances.

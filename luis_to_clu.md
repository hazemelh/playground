# Migration from Language Understanding (LUIS) to conversational language understanding (CLU)
## Executive Summary
[Conversational Language Understanding (CLU)]() is one of the cloud-based API services offered by Azure Cognitive Services for Language. It is the newest generation of [Language Understanding Service (LUIS)]() and therefore offers backwards compatibility with previously created LUIS applications. CLU employs state-of-the-art machine-learning intelligence to allow users to build a custom natural language understanding model for the prediction of intents and entities of conversational utterances. 

CLU offers the following advantages over LUIS: 

1. Improved accuracy with state-of-the-art machine learning models for better intent classification and entity extraction. 
2. Multilingual support for model learning and training. 
3. Ease of integration with different CLU and custom question answering projects using [orchestration workflow](), available in the [Language Studio](). 
4. The ability to add testing data easily within the experience using the Language Studio and APIs for model performance evaluation prior to deployment. 

To get started you can [create a new project]() or [import your LUIS application]().
